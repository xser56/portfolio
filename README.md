Description: Made a portfolio website with some projects and skills I have developt over the year.

## Peer Review: Santiago Montanez

- The navigation menu button "Projects" appears to lead nowhere. The url reflects a change. I recommend having it take the user to your projects and opens one of the accordians
- I like the hero section as it uses what appears to be animated bubbles. However, the space to the right appears empty. I suggest maybe enlarging your text on the hero section, so it takes more space and doesn't appear as empty
- Small typo in your 'About Me' text. You forgot an " ' " in "... Im looking to..." you can add it in without error by placing " &apos; " or "& apos ;" with no spaces in between
- I think this is a great start to a web portfolio. Not a whole lot of styling, but it is very clean and easy to navigate.
